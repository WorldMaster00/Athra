   <p class="P1 ">The First Era. <br></br>The First recorded age of man.<br><br> Otherwise known as The Golden era, due to its advancements in magic and autonomy. The world relished in its ability to advance. Many great individuals pioneered aspects of life.<br><br> Magic, Machines, exploration, industry and much more.<br></br>Kingdoms ruled for a hundred years, as is the length of an era.<br><br>With no war, no famine, no crime. One hundred years of perpetual, everlasting peace.<br><br> But would it last?<br><br> This was the most uneventful of times in the world. There was no evil in sight, other than the odd criminal or bandit. <br></br>Though this time was a time of peace and quiet, there was much to be recognised and recorded, for advancements of civilisations ranged far and wide.<br><br> Irrigation, farming, forgery, ect, as well as the other advancements mentioned above.<br></br>Time passed into The Second Era, which brings us to the current era of the world and the present time and day of the roleplay at hand.<br><br> YOU Will shape this Era. Your kingdoms, your characters, your choices, your stories.<br><br>What part will you play, in shaping this world?
