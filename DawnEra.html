 <div class="B1">
   <p class="P1 ">The Dawn of true civilisation...<br><br>The Dawn of Men. The most prominent race among all... And within the earliest of their days, they knew but nothing, other than war and hatred for one another...<br> 
     <br> During this time, races sprung up in vast populations across Athra and the wider world. <br><br>War was waged constantly and the kingdoms rose and fell...<br></br>Nothing noteworthy happened during this time. No vast histories or sprawling empires. <br><br>Nothing lasted long enough... <br></br>Time passed and survival of the fittest became a truer nation each passing day <br></br>Until only the older selves of the current kingdoms remained.<br><br>

Peace was finally achieved, but at the cost of blood. Enough blood to fill oceans. Much of the land was unused during this time. <br><br>Most of it was wild and untamed. Even now... <br><br>

Old kingdoms survived, while new ones formed and treaties were made. Peace was the priority of most, while others secrelty plotted, but nevertheless... <br><br>

There was peace... <br><br> 

And that peace was extended way into The First Era.
