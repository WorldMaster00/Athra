   <p class="P1 ">Long ago... In the age of Primordials... <br><br> Titans roamed the plane and the gods still walked among the world that would come to be. <br></br>No races or creatures of today were present, only the large leviathans and giants of the old world. <br><br>During this time, these hulking, world-shaking titans fought, some brandishing large weapons, while others took the form of large serpentines. Their chaos was unending.<br></br>Their fighting was constant. Soon enough, many passed into myth and legend and what little of them remained, wandered the world alone.</br></br>Time passed and the gods moved on, spinning the races of this world into creation. <br></br>However, spiteful and dominant, the Primordials of this plane, acted their judgement upon them, erupting into rage and destroying what little the races of this world had begun to create.<br><br>

The gods acted quickly, using what power they had to erase and destroy most of the primordials, sealing away the remaining ones that were too powerful to be killed at the time by the young gods.<br></br> Now their corpses... Their remenants, remain. <br></br>A remainder of what once was.<br></br>
